# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON

"""
= OOP is a programming pradigm that organzises code around objects rather than functions or procedures
= Objects are instances of classes, wich act as blue prints defining the properties (data) and behaviours
(fucntions/ methods) of those objects.
= OOP models reaa world entities, making code mofre intuitive and modular.

# CONECEPTS OF OOP
"""
= Classes & Objects
    - A class is a template and an object is an instance of that class
= Encapsulation 
    - Building data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, controlling access to protect data integrity
= Inheritance
    - A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class promotting code reuse
= Polymorpshism
    - Objects of diffrent classes can be treated as objects of a common baseclass, allowing flexibilty
= Abstraction
    - Hiding complex inplementation details and exposing only necessary features to the user
